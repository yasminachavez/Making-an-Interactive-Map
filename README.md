# Project - Create an Interactive Map

This map utilizes the Leaflet library and Foursquare API to map the users geolocation coordinates onto a map. The user is then able to select a business type and have businesses add to the map.  

This project is meant to be completed independently. The code here may be used as a reference, but it is expected that every project will differ.

## Minimum Steps to Produce
* Get the user's current location.  
* Map that location on a Leaflet map.  
* Allow the user to select a business type from a select list and map the 5 nearest locations on the same map using the Foursquare API.
